2D Normal Maps in Excel

ReadMe

This excel file allows you to gain an intuitive understanding of how 2D normal maps work in the basic setting of an excel workbook.
This model allows you to input a texture / sprite and overlay it was a normal map. You can then add a light at various locations to see the impact of that light on the texture - with nice mock-3D lighting!
I hope this is of help for those trying to learn the basics of 2D normal maps and lighting!

Instructions:

First, you need to go to the sheet named "Calcs". You can add in a texture into the first grid, and the appropriate normal map into the second set of grids.
Then, you need to go to the sheet named "Screen". You can either move the light to any position you want, or animate the light along various pre-determined routes.
This can be done by selecting the various buttons available.
